# EllipseUtils

This project contains some utilities in order to work with ellipses.

You will find code for a least-square-fit of a ellipse to a list of points (adapted from this paper:  http://autotrace.sourceforge.net/WSCG98.pdf)

The library is header-only and should work with any decent C++-compiler.
